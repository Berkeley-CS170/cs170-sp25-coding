    "## Q1: Traveling Salesperson DP\n",
    "Now, we'll implement the dynamic programming algorithm for the traveling salesperson problem (TSP). A brute force solution will be hopelessly slow even for moderate-sized test cases, but we can use dynamic programming to get a solution in slightly more reasonable (but still exponential) time. For a refresher on the TSP algorithm, see Lecture 13 or https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/algorithms/chap6.pdf#page=20. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with previous problems, we want you to return the actual tour, not the cost of the tour. We can once again apply the same procedure of backtracking through our subproblem array to reconstruct this tour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Representing Subproblems\n",
    "If we use a set as one of our subproblem parameters, we can't directly use a 2D array to store our subproblems. There are two common ways to work around this issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Subproblem Dictionary\n",
    "You could store subproblems in a dictionary, where the keys are tuples of the form `(S, i)`, where `i` represents the last city visited before returning home and `S` is the set of cities visited so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make this work, you need to ensure that the keys are hashable. One way is using Python's built-in `frozenset` class for `S`. `frozenset` is a built-in type so you can use it without any additional imports, and works just like a normal set, except that it is immutable (and hashable). You can read more about `frozenset` here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#frozenset.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Bitmasking\n",
    "Instead of a hash set, we actually *can* still use a 2D array to store subproblems, where `S` is represented as an $n$-bit unsigned integer, and the $i$-th bit of `S` would be set to 1 if and only if the $i$-th city is part of the set of visited cities. Since `S` is an integer, we can use it to index into our 2D array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bitmasking approach tends to be about twice as fast and much more memory-efficient than the `frozenset` approach, but both approaches will pass the autograder if implemented correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation tip:\n",
    "As with before, storing the entire tour at each step is too memory-intensive and will cause the autograder to fail. Instead, consider maintaining a separate dictionary or array which stores a smaller amount of information but can still help you reconstruct the tour (can the \"shortest path in the DP DAG\" idea help here?).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Be careful with indexing!** The algorithm from the book assumes your cities are labeled $1, \\dots, n$ - if you are indexing into a Python list, will you need to adjust your indices?\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful with subproblem ordering! We need to ensure that whenever we go to solve a subproblem, all of the subproblems it depends on have already been solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The graph is not necessarily complete! If no tour is possible, return an empty list."

    "### Graph helpers\n",
    "Like the last homeworks, we use a weighted adjacency list to represent the graph. We'll use a similar format as before, except `graph[u]` is now a hashmap instead of a list of pairs. \n",
    " **For this assignment, graphs are undirected**, so if there is an (undirected) edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`, then `graph[u]` contains key `v` with value `w` and `graph[v]` contains key `u` with value `w`.\n",
